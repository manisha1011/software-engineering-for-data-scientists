## Some ideas

There are two backgrounds in Data Science:

- Statistics, Mathematics, Physics, Economics, etc.
- Computer Science

> I realized that some CS people end up working as Data Engineers but other works in specialized fields like NLP. Some NLP positions ask only for CS backgrounds. 

I can devote the courses to those people coming from an statistical background mainly.
