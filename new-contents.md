The following topics are relevant for Data Scientists

- Modularity
- Documentation
- Testing
- version Control & Git

The above four topics comes from the introductory video in the following DataCamp couse:

[software engineering for data scientists in python datacamp lesson 1](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-in-python/software-engineering-data-science?ex=1)
>The above course don't cover version control and git topic.

Recently, Udacity also realesed a new version for their "[Data Science Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)" with the following information in the pdf version of the [syllabus](https://github.com/markeyser/software-engineering-for-data-scientists/blob/master/documents/Data%2BScientist%2BNanodegree%2BSyllabus.pdf):

## Logging 

The following presentation is really good:

- [Albert Sweigart, "Logging and Testing and Debugging, Oh My!", PyBay2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONCVvS-gDMA)

The speaker is the author of this [this book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter10/), here more information. 

The above talk is about logging, debugging, testing (doctest package). The discussion at the end of the presentation is really intesting. They talked about [this](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/04/06/stop-using-print-for-debugging-a-5-minute-quickstart-guide-to-pythons-logging-module/). 

By the way, an Atom package for debbuing [here](https://atom.io/packages/python-debugger).
