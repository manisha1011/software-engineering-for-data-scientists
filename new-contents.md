_Data Scientists (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician._

[source](http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/04/engineering-practices-in-data-science/)

The following article is mentions the opinion of Joel Grus abut software engineering in Data Science:

_Overall, Joel’s objections to Jupyter notebooks seem to come in large part from his somewhat philosophical view that **data scientists should follow the same set of best practices that any good software engineers would**. For instance, Joel stresses the importance of [writing unit tests](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe/?source=post_stats_page---------------------------) (even for data science code), and is a strong proponent of using type annotation (if you aren’t familiar with that, you should [definitely learn about it here](https://medium.com/@shamir.stav_83310/the-other-great-benefit-of-python-type-annotations-896c7d077c6b))._

The following topics are relevant for Data Scientists

- Modularity
- Documentation
- Testing
- version Control & Git

The above four topics comes from the introductory video in the following DataCamp couse:

[software engineering for data scientists in python datacamp lesson 1](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-in-python/software-engineering-data-science?ex=1)
>The above course don't cover version control and git topic.

Recently, Udacity also realesed a new version for their "[Data Science Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)" with the following information in the pdf version of the [syllabus](https://github.com/markeyser/software-engineering-for-data-scientists/blob/master/documents/Data%2BScientist%2BNanodegree%2BSyllabus.pdf):

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICES

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code
- Refactor code for efficiency
- Create unit tests to test programs
- Write useful programs in multiple scripts
- Track actions and results of processes with logging
- Conduct and receive code reviews

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

- Understand when to use object oriented programming
- Build and use classes
- Understand magic methods
- Write programs that include multiple classes, and follow good code structure
- Learn how large, modular Python packages, such as pandas and scikit-learn, use object oriented programming
- Portfolio Exercise : Build your own Python package

WEB DEVELOPMENT

- Learn about the components of a web app
- Build a web application that uses Flask, Plotly, and the Bootstrap framework
- Portfolio Exercise : Build a data dashboard

In the following course:

- [Software-engineering-for-data-scientists-and-successfully-delivering-data-science-projects](https://ianozsvald.com/2019/04/24/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-and-successfully-delivering-data-science-projects-2-courses-for-may/)

We can see the agenda [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-tickets-66241132009?aff=erelexpmlt):

During the course we'll:

-   Develop defensive coding practices in our Notebook which double up as documentation
-   Refactor Notebook code into modules for reuse and increased trust
-   Add unit-tests to test our modules for trust and integration with a Continuous Integration pipeline
-   Review a git process that uses nbdime for collaboration on Jupyter Notebooks
-   Practice code reviews backed by a documented process you can take back to your team
-   Review a standard research-to-deployment process using cookiecutter  
    
-   Discuss how to sell these new techniques to team members and senior staff to get critical buy-in to see change occur after the course
-   Look at how "traditional" software engineering and "data science engineering" differ to highlight process differences that your software engineering colleagues probably haven't seen
-   Write useful documentation in our code to improve future support

## Logging 

The following presentation is really good:

- [Albert Sweigart, "Logging and Testing and Debugging, Oh My!", PyBay2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONCVvS-gDMA)

The speaker is the author of this [this book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter10/), here more information. 

The above talk is about logging, debugging, testing (doctest package). The discussion at the end of the presentation is really intesting. They talked about [this](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/04/06/stop-using-print-for-debugging-a-5-minute-quickstart-guide-to-pythons-logging-module/). 

By the way, an Atom package for debbuing [here](https://atom.io/packages/python-debugger).

## Packaging 

- [Creating-a-python-package-for-ubuntu-from-code-zero-to-apt-install](https://medium.com/@trstringer/creating-a-python-package-for-ubuntu-from-code-zero-to-apt-install-d02d0108144c)

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqJyaejvVjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqJyaejvVjQ)

## Online IDEs

- [Start Coding in Your Browser With Microsoft Visual Studio Online](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/coding-browser-microsoft-visual-studio-online/)

From the above article:

>###  Doesn’t This Already Exist?
>
>Fully online IDEs are nothing new and Amazon’s AWS Cloud9 IDE is a robust environment rich in features. Similarly, there are many online subscription services designed for smaller scale group development.
>
>There are even online IDEs which use VS Code’s open source codebase, and anyone familiar with the software will feel quite at home.
>
>Having a remote environment accessible both through the browser and locally is technically possible with any one of these services. In contrast what Visual Studio Online will likely do is make it a more streamlined and accessible experience
