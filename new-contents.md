The following topics are relevant for Data Scientists

- Modularity
- Documentation
- Testing
- version Control & Git

The above four topics comes from the introductory video in the following DataCamp couse:

[software engineering for data scientists in python datacamp lesson 1](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-in-python/software-engineering-data-science?ex=1)
>The above course don't cover version control and git topic.

Recently, Udacity also realesed a new version for their "[Data Science Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)" with the following information in the pdf version of the [syllabus](https://github.com/markeyser/software-engineering-for-data-scientists/blob/master/documents/Data%2BScientist%2BNanodegree%2BSyllabus.pdf):

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICES

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code
- Refactor code for efficiency
- Create unit tests to test programs
- Write useful programs in multiple scripts
- Track actions and results of processes with logging
- Conduct and receive code reviews

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

- Understand when to use object oriented programming
- Build and use classes
- Understand magic methods
- Write programs that include multiple classes, and follow good code structure
- Learn how large, modular Python packages, such as pandas and scikit-learn, use object oriented programming
- Portfolio Exercise : Build your own Python package

WEB DEVELOPMENT

- Learn about the components of a web app
- Build a web application that uses Flask, Plotly, and the Bootstrap framework
- Portfolio Exercise : Build a data dashboard

## Git & GitHub training courses
 
For Git and GitHub I've found that the following coureses have the right content:

- [Version Control with git - Udacity - Free course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)
- [GitHub & Collaboration- Udacity - free course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/github-collaboration--ud456)
- [Optimize your GitHub](https://eu.udacity.com/course/optimize-your-github--ud247)

## A fantastic presentation

The following tutorial is really interesting:

- [Data Science is Software | SciPy 2016 Tutorial | Peter Bull & Isaac Slavitt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKUy0TSLg04)

Agenda
- Project structure
- Environments and reproducibility
- Coding for reusability
- Testing
- Collaboration

I forked the repository of this presentation. The LinkedIn profile of the speakers are interesting.
