The following topics are relevant for Data Scientists

- Modularity
- Documentation
- Testing
- version Control & Git

The above four topics comes from the introductory video in the following DataCamp couse:

[software engineering for data scientists in python datacamp lesson 1](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-in-python/software-engineering-data-science?ex=1)
>The above course don't cover version control and git topic.

Recently, Udacity also realesed a new version for their "[Data Science Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)" with the following information in the pdf version of the [syllabus](https://github.com/markeyser/software-engineering-for-data-scientists/blob/master/documents/Data%2BScientist%2BNanodegree%2BSyllabus.pdf):

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICES

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code
- Refactor code for efficiency
- Create unit tests to test programs
- Write useful programs in multiple scripts
- Track actions and results of processes with logging
- Conduct and receive code reviews

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

- Understand when to use object oriented programming
- Build and use classes
- Understand magic methods
- Write programs that include multiple classes, and follow good code structure
- Learn how large, modular Python packages, such as pandas and scikit-learn, use object oriented programming
- Portfolio Exercise : Build your own Python package

- [Trey Causey: Testing for Data Scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqM9uJi64Q)

In the above presentation there is an slide naming some interesting software development skills for data scientists [here more ](http://treycausey.com/software_dev_skills.html):

- writing modular, reusable code
- Documentation
- Version control
- Testing
- Logging
